# Applying what I learn!🤹‍♀️
Here i have tried to solve the problem we usually faced ie. sometimes when we put text over image the text is not visible it get mixed with background.
So the possible solution could be:
1. I came accross this [article](https://css-tricks.com/methods-contrasting-text-backgrounds/). Here they used to clip the text by putting the layer of opposite of background. But this need to done on every picture and not scalable.
2. use the `Backgound-blend-mode` it is scalable and give the perfect blend in most of image.

## What are the things i have implemented in the project?
1. Slidable side bar 
2. Sticky navbar
3. Input that accepts a string and iterates a card for each letter entered.(Every letter typed should create a new card) The card should contain an image & every third card should be highlighted with a different color.
4. The slider with text over image and having blend mode
5. The fixed youtube video at the bottom
6. Fully responsive
